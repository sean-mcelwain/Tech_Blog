 ## Installation 
This project is dependent on Node.js and the express, sequelize, and mysql2 packages.  In order to install this app, Node and MySQL must be installed and accessible via the command line application on the local computer.  Then, prior to execution of "server.js" contained in the directory of the utility, the should run: (1) the command "npm install" in the local directory containing the utiltiy to install the dependencies, (2) the code in db/schema.sql in the MySQL terminal to create the database, (3) the command "npm run seed" to seed the database with data for manipulation, and (4) "npm start" to execute the server.js file in the local directory. 

Alternatively, this app can be used via the deployment on Heroku without installation described above.
